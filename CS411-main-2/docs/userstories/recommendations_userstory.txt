As a signed in user, I want to receive a list of recommendations for ebooks based on my imported Spotify playlist themes. On successful import, our 
algorithm will consider the different themes of the songs in the playlist and return ebooks with similar themes. The displayed page will be a 
directory with buttons linking to the ebooks. Upon failure of import, there will be a popup message showing the reason why the import failed with an option 
to retry. If the algorithm does not return an ebook or the requested 5 ebooks, another message specifying the reason will be displayed with an option to retry.
