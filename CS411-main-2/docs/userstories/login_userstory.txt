As a user, I will be able to login via my Spotify account information. If I am not an authenticated user, I will be at a login page where I put in my 
account information. Afterward, I will be taken to the website where they can see my Spotify playlists and start to get recommended ebooks. 
If I am already authenticated, I should already see my playlists and ebooks. If the my credentials are rejected, I will be notified my account information 
is incorrect and I will not leave the login page.
