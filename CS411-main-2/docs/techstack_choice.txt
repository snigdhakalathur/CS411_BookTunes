The two technology stacks that we have considered are MERN stack and Python-Django stack (ultimately deciding on MERN stack). For the MERN stack, the technologies we 
considered include ReactJS for the frontend, Express and Node for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. For the Python-Django stack, we thought to use Python with HTML5 
and CSS3 for the frontend and Python for the backend with a SQLite database. One reason we chose MERN stack over Python-Django stack is because ReactJS is more responsive 
and reactive than HTML and CSS, so user experience will be more enjoyable with a MERN stack approach. Another reason we chose MERN stack is that MongoDB is a NoSQL database
which also means it is very horizontally scalable, which may come in handy for storing users, ebook titles, and spotify playlist themes. In addition, Python-Django's SQLite 
database is a relational database, but we ultimately decided that a relational database is not necessary for our project. This is why we chose to use MERN stack with ReactJS, 
Express, Node, and MongoDB.
