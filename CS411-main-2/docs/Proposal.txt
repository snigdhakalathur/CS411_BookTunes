Proposal 1 (Recommending eBooks based on music users listens to)

The idea of this project is to analyze a userâ€™s playlists and favorite songs on Spotify, and recommend ebooks for them based on common themes, keywords, genres 
etc., providing a link to access the ebook online. Ultimately, we want to suggest ebooks a user might like based on the music they like. OAuth will be used for the 
user to log into their Spotify account. The APIs we would use would be from Spotify, a free ebook API, like Open Library, and possibly an API for searching lyrics 
(in case we want to do some text analysis of lyrics to determine themes, keywords, etc).  A database would be used to map certain genres, keywords, artists, albums
to free available ebooks online.



Proposal 2 (Airline / Hotel Reservation System)

This project is to create a reservation system which books airline seats or hotel rooms. The Web application will charge various rates for particular sections 
of the plane or hotel. For instance, price will be higher during weekends than weekdays. First class flights will cost more than coach and suites will cost more 
than standard rooms. This web application will keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled as well. We will use an API for flight search, 
such as Skyscanner Flight Search, and the TripAdvisor API, which is a web service that queries real-time flight prices, hotel bookings, restaurants, attractions, 
and more. We will use the Google Oauth to add events, such as flights and hotel stays into Google Calendars.
